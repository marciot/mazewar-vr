Mazewar VR
==========

![alt text][logo]

Maze War VR is a remake of the game written by Steve Colley and Greg Thompson in 1974 at the NASA Ames
Research Center in California. The game allowed players to hunt down opponents in a three-dimensional
maze, making it the very first first person shooter game.

Maze War VR recreates the game in virtual reality. This remake is designed specifically for smartphones
and inexpensive VR headsets such as the [Mattel ViewMaster VR][1].

Maze War VR is built using modern web technologies such as WebGL. The plan is to support multi-player
mode through WebRTC and for the game to speak the same line protocol as the Maze War did on the Xerox
Alto, allowing for game play with players playing the original on an online [Xerox Alto Emulator][2].

The game is currently playable in single player mode under Chrome. You can try it
